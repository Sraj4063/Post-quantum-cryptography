Post-quantum cryptography is a term used in the field of cryptography to describe cryptographic algorithms (typically public-key algorithms) that are thought to be 
secure against a cryptanalytic attack by a quantum computer. It is also referred to as quantum-proof, quantum-safe, or quantum-resistant. The issue with existing common 
algorithms is that their security depends on one of three challenging mathematical problems: the discrete logarithm problem, the discrete logarithm problem with elliptic 
curves, or the integer factorization problem. On a sufficiently powerful quantum computer executing Shor's algorithm, all of these issues might be readily resolved.

Numerous cryptographers are developing new algorithms to be ready for a day when quantum computing poses a threat, despite the fact that the publicly known experimental 
quantum computers now under development lack the processing capability to defeat any practical cryptographic algorithm[3]. Since 2006, the PQCrypto conference series has
drawn increased interest from academia and business, and more recently, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the Institute for Quantum Computing 
have organised a number of Quantum Safe Cryptography seminars.

Contrary to the danger that quantum computing poses to existing public-key methods, the majority of existing symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are 
thought to be quite safe against assaults by quantum computers. Increasing the key size can successfully thwart attacks against symmetric cyphers, even though the 
quantum Grover's technique speeds up these attacks.
Therefore, there is no need for post-quantum symmetric cryptography to deviate considerably from symmetric cryptography as it is now.
